ICACTI stands for Infrared Camera for Astrophysical and Cosmological Transient Interface.
This code is meant to be used with the Goodrich SWIR InGaAs camera interfacing with a National Instruments PCI Board (PCIE1427) running on Windows 7.
The IR_CAMERA.py is the interface with the camera.
The IR_CAMERA_GUI.py provides a user friendly gui to interact with the camera, and calls on the functions defined in the IR_CAMERA.py code.
Instrunctions for use:
Run IR_CAMERA_GUI.py
If different exposure times are desired change them in expsoure time (only multiples of 1 second should be entered)
In the GUI click Initialize Camera
Snap gives a single image of the camera at the given exposure time.
Storing a background is useful for identifying sources. Click store background while the sensor (or telescope is covered).
Having a stored background will automatically subtract the newly stored dark frame from any subsequent images to be displayed.  Any data that is saved will not be dark subtracted.
The frame median is read out after every exposure.
Toggling "Graphing On" will display images as they are saved, as well as a histogram; this will however drastically slow data collection rates.
Toggling "Write to Disk" will write each individual frame to disk. For example if you set the exposure time to 5 seconds, a new frame will be saved for every 5 seconds of data collected.
If you want to change exposure times, you will need to click "Close Camera Interface", change the exposure length, then click "initialize Camera".
In case of failure, always try to close the program and restart it.
